# Donations-Management-System-C-Programming
The coronavirus, often known as SARS-CoV-2, is a lethal virus that has caused an epidemic that has spread globally (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). The World Health Organization refers to the condition caused by a coronavirus as "coronavirus disease" (COVID-19) There are no well-established treatments or specific medications that can be utilised to treat patients. In Malaysia, the vaccination campaign has just begun. The company has tasked us with creating a covid -19 Donations management system to aid in the organisation of the process.

I believe the following abilities I can contribute to the Donations Management System will be helpful in these trying times.

• Making an inventory.
• Refresh contribution totals.
• Use the contribution code to search for donations and their available quantities.
• Create a list of all donations, together with the amounts that were disbursed.

By implementing a program with these features, the corporation will just be capable of keeping track of what is in the stock, however many fresh stocks they are receiving, and what immunizations and mask supplies they are supplying.
